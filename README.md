* Then the user is given multiple browser options to choose from depending on the user's preferences


* Assuming the user has on of the three popular Internet browsers (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox or Microsoft Edge) and selects one of them, UiPath automatically opens up my LinkedIn profile page (URL is provided within the RPA code) and then finds the 'Portfolio' link, clicks on it as part of the RPA process and opens up the second webpage which is my GitHub home page
